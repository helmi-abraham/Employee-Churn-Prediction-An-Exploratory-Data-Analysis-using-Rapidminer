# Employee-Churn-Prediction-An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-Rapidminer
Conducted an in-depth EDA on the HR dataset using Rapidminer to uncover patterns influencing employee turnover. Explored relationships between satisfaction, workload, promotions, salary, and department with respect to churn. Key findings highlighted that low satisfaction, excessive workload, lack of promotions, and low salaries significantly increase attrition risk. Produced visual insights (correlation plots, categorical comparisons) that can guide HR teams in designing retention strategies such as improving employee satisfaction and reducing burnout.
